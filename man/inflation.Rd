\title{Calculate Inflation Between Two Dates}
\usage{
inflation(initial_date, end_date, index = c("ipca", "inpc", "igpm",
  "igpdi", "ipc"))
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_date}{Initial date in the 'MM/YYYY' format (\code{character}).}

\item{end_date}{End date in the 'MM/YYYY' format (\code{character}).}

\item{index}{One of the following options: \code{ipca}, \code{inpc}, \code{igpm}, \code{igpdi}, and \code{ipc}. Each one
of these options uses the following price indexes, respectively: IPCA and INPC indexes maintained by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE); and
IGP-M, IGP-DI, and IPC maintained by Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). For an overview of the indexes' methodologies
and covered periods, check the Brazilian Central Bank official \href{https://www.bcb.gov.br/conteudo/home-en/FAQs/FAQ\%2002-Price\%20Indices.pdf}{FAQ}.}
}
\value{
The inflation rate, in percent, between \code{initial_date} and \code{end_date}.
}
\description{
\code{inflation()} is a convenience function used to calculate the inflation rate between two periods
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Inflation rate between January 2010 to January 2018 calculated using IPCA price index
inflation("01/2010", "01/2018", "ipca")

# Inflation rate between January 2014 to December 2014 calculated using IGP-M price index
inflation("01/2014", "12/2014", "igpm")
